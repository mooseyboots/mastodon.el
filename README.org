** Installation

Clone this repository and add the lisp directory to your load path.
Then, require it and go.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
    (require 'mastodon)
#+END_SRC

*** use-package

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
#+END_SRC

*** MELPA
I'll make mastdon.el available on MELPA when I feel like it's reached a
stable state.

*** Discover

=mastodon-mode= will provide a context menu for its keybindings if =discover=
is installed. It is not required.

** Usage

*** Instance

Set =mastodon-instance-url= in your =.emacs= or =customize=. Defaults to the [[https://mastodon.social][flagship]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq mastodon-instance-url "https://my.instance.url")
#+END_SRC

*** App registration

=M-x mastodon-register=

Retrieves =client_id= and =client_secret= tokens. They're stored in the =mastdon-token-file=.
This value can be customized too, and defaults to
=${EMACS_HOME_DIRECTORY}/mastodon.plstore=.

*** Timelines

=M-x mastodon=

Opens a =*mastodon-home*= buffer in the major mode so you can see toots.

| =(F)=  | I favourited this toot. |
|--------+-------------------------|

*** Toot toot

=M-x mastodon-toot=

Pops a new buffer/window with a =mastodon-toot= minor mode. Enter the
contents of your toot here. =C-c C-c= sends the toot.
=C-c C-k= cancels. Both actions kill the buffer and window.

If you have not previously authenticated, you will be prompted for your
account email and password. *NOTE*: Email and
password are NOT stored by mastodon.el.

Authentication stores your access token in the
=mastodon--api-token-string= variable. It is not stored on your
filesystem, so
you will have to re-authenticate when you close/reopen Emacs.
