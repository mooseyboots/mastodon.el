* mastodon.el updated

This is an updated version of the great but seemingly dormant mastodon client for emacs.

[The original readme is below.]

It adds the following features:

| Profiles:       |                                                                                    |

It also makes some small cosmetic changes to make timelines easier to read, and makes some functions asynchronous, based on https://github.com/ieure/mastodon.el.

The minimum Emacs version is now 27.1. But if you are running an older version it shouldn't be very hard to get it working.

** live-updating timelines: =mastodon-async-mode=

(code taken from https://github.com/alexjgriffith/mastodon-future.el.)

Works for federated, local, and home timelines and for notifications. It's a little touchy, one thing to avoid is trying to load a timeline more than once at a time. It can go off the rails a bit, but it's still pretty cool.

To enable, it, add =(require 'mastodon-async)= to your =init.el=. Then you can view a timeline with one of the commands that begin with =mastodon-async--stream-=.

** NB: dependencies

This version depends on the library =request= (for uploading attachments). You can install it from MELPA, or https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request. It also depends on =seq=.

Optional dependencies are =company= for autocompletion of mentions when composing a toot, and =emojify= for inserting and viewing emojis.

** NB: bugs

This repo also incorporates fixes for two bugs that were never merged into the upstream repo: 
- https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el/issues/227 (and https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el/issues/234)
- https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el/issues/228

** 2FA

It looks like 2-factor auth was never completed in the original repo. It's not a priority for me, auth ain't my thing. If you want to hack on it, its on the develop branch in the original repo.

** contributing

Contributions are welcome. Registration is disabled by default on the gitea instance, but if you are interested, get in touch with me on mastodon: [[https://todon.nl/@mousebot][@mousebot@todon.nl]]. Or just leave an issue on github.

For now, to get started with hacking, pull off the develop branch of the blast repo.
* Original README

** Installation

Clone this repository and add the lisp directory to your load path.
Then, require it and go.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
    (require 'mastodon)
#+END_SRC

Or, with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

*** MELPA

Add =MELPA= to your archives:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Update and install:

=M-x package-refresh-contents RET=

=M-x package-install RET mastodon RET=

*** Emoji

=mastodon-mode= will enable [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][Emojify]] if it is loaded in your Emacs environment, so
there's no need to write your own hook anymore. =emojify-mode= is not required.

*** Discover

=mastodon-mode= can provide a context menu for its keybindings if [[https://github.com/mickeynp/discover.el][Discover]] is
installed. It is not required.

if you have Discover, add the following to your Emacs init configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'mastodon-discover)
  (with-eval-after-load 'mastodon (mastodon-discover))
#+END_SRC

Or, with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :ensure t
    :config
    (mastodon-discover))
#+END_SRC

** Usage
*** 2 Factor Auth
2FA is not supported yet. It is in the [[https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el/milestone/2][plans]] for the =1.0.0= release.

If you have 2FA enabled and try to use mastodon.el, your Emacs client will hang until you `C-g` your way out.
*** Instance

Set =mastodon-instance-url= in your =.emacs= or =customize=. Defaults to the [[https://mastodon.social][flagship]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq mastodon-instance-url "https://my.instance.url")
#+END_SRC

There is an option to have your user credentials (email address and password) saved to disk so you don't have to re-enter them on every restart.
The default is not to do this because if not properly configured it would save these unencrypted which is not a good default to have.
Customize the variable =mastodon-auth-source-file= if you want to enable this feature.

*** Timelines

=M-x mastodon=

Opens a =*mastodon-home*= buffer in the major mode so you can see toots. You will be prompted for email and password. The app registration process will take place if your =mastodon-token-file= does not contain =:client_id= and =:client_secret=.

**** Legend

|--------+-------------------------|
| Marker | Meaning                 |
|--------+-------------------------|
| =(B)=  | I boosted this toot.    |
| =(F)=  | I favourited this toot. |
|--------+-------------------------|

*** Toot toot

=M-x mastodon-toot=

Pops a new buffer/window with a =mastodon-toot= minor mode. Enter the
contents of your toot here. =C-c C-c= sends the toot. =C-c C-k= cancels.
Both actions kill the buffer and window.

If you have not previously authenticated, you will be prompted for your
account email and password. *NOTE*: Email and password are NOT stored by mastodon.el.

Authentication stores your access token in the =mastodon-auth--token=
variable. It is not stored on your filesystem, so you will have to
re-authenticate when you close/reopen Emacs.

**** Customization
The default toot visibility can be changed by setting or customizing the =mastodon-toot--default-visibility= variable. Valid values are ="public"=, ="unlisted"=, ="private"=, or =direct=.

Toot visibility can also be changed on a per-toot basis from the new toot buffer.

**** Keybindings

|-----------+------------------------|
| Key       | Action                 |
|-----------+------------------------|
| =C-c C-c= | Send toot              |
| =C-c C-k= | Cancel toot            |
| =C-c C-w= | Add content warning    |
| =C-c C-v= | Change toot visibility |
|-----------+------------------------|
