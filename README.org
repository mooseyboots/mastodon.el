** Installation

Clone this repository and add the lisp directory to your load path.
Then, require it and go.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
    (require 'mastodon)
#+END_SRC

Or, with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
#+END_SRC

*** MELPA

Add =MELPA= to your archives:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Update and install:

=M-x package-refresh-contents RET=

=M-x package-install RET mastodon RET=

*** Emoji

=mastodon-mode= will enable [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][Emojify]] if it is loaded in your Emacs environment, so
there's no need to write your own hook anymore. =emojify-mode= is not required.

*** Discover

=mastodon-mode= will provide a context menu for its keybindings if [[https://github.com/mickeynp/discover.el][Discover]] is
installed. It is not required.

** Usage
*** Instance

Set =mastodon-instance-url= in your =.emacs= or =customize=. Defaults to the [[https://mastodon.social][flagship]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq mastodon-instance-url "https://my.instance.url")
#+END_SRC

There is an option to have your user credentials (email address and password) saved to disk so you don't have to re-enter them on every restart.
The default is not to do this because if not properly configured it would save these unencrypted which is not a good default to have.
Customize the variable =mastodon-auth-source-file= if you want to enable this feature.

*** 2 Factor Auth
**** Overview
After setting up =mastodon-instance-url= set the following in your
=.emacs= or =customize=:

1. =mastodon-auth-mechanism=

**** Set up
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mastodon-auth-mechanism "oauth2")
#+END_SRC

The OAuth2 library uses =plstore= to securely store the credentials.
We recommend you input a strong password when you are asked by the
package.

*** Timelines

=M-x mastodon=

Opens a =*mastodon-home*= buffer in the major mode so you can see toots. You will be prompted for email and password. The app registration process will take place if your =mastodon-token-file= does not contain =:client_id= and =:client_secret=.

*** Toot toot

=M-x mastodon-toot=

Pops a new buffer/window with a =mastodon-toot= minor mode. Enter the
contents of your toot here. =C-c C-c= sends the toot. =C-c C-k= cancels.
Both actions kill the buffer and window.

If you have not previously authenticated, you will be prompted for your
account email and password. *NOTE*: Email and password are NOT stored by mastodon.el.

Authentication stores your access token in the =mastodon-auth--token=
variable. It is not stored on your filesystem, so you will have to
re-authenticate when you close/reopen Emacs.

**** Customization
The default toot visibility can be changed by setting or customizing the =mastodon-toot--default-visibility= variable. Valid values are ="public"=, ="unlisted"=, ="private"=, or =direct=.

Toot visibility can also be changed on a per-toot basis from the new toot buffer.

**** Keybindings

|-----------+------------------------|
| Key       | Action                 |
|-----------+------------------------|
| =C-c C-c= | Send toot              |
| =C-c C-k= | Cancel toot            |
| =C-c C-w= | Add content warning    |
| =C-c C-v= | Change toot visibility |
|-----------+------------------------|
>>>>>>> Make default visibility customizable; add documentation.
